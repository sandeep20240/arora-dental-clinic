                  <Strong>A.Tooth decay and periodontal</Strong> disease are the most common causes of tooth loss. Tooth
                  decay takes place when most of the tooth's mineral makeup has been dissolved away and a hole (cavity)
                  has formed. While tooth decay primarily affects children, periodontal disease, or gum disease, affects
                  mostly adults. Periodontal disease is an infection of the gums caused by the buildup of plaque, and
                  its earliest stage is known as gingivitis.

                  starches in the food you eat. This can produce an acid that can eat away the enamel on your tooth. If
                  a cavity is left untreated, it can lead to more serious oral health problems. Cavities can be

                  least once.

                  tobacco use, teeth grinding, some medications, and genetics. Gingivitis is the beginning stage of gum
                  disease, and, if detected, is treatable. However, if you have gingivitis and it is left untreated, it
                  may turn into gum disease. Advanced gum disease will lead to tooth and bone loss, and is a permanent
                  condition. Brushing your teeth regularly, and visiting the dentist every six months will help prevent
                  gingivitis and more severe cases of periodontal disease.

                  <Strong>A. Brushing and ossing help</Strong>control the plaque and bacteria that cause dental disease.
                  Plaque is a film of food debris, bacteria, and saliva that sticks to the teeth and gums. The bacteria
                  in plaque convert certain food particles into acids that cause tooth decay. Also, if plaque is not
                  removed, it turns into calculus (tartar). If plaque and calculus are not removed, they begin to
                  destroy the gums and bone, causing periodontal (gum) disease. Plaque formation and growth is
                  continuous and can only be controlled by regular brushing, flossing, and the use of other dental aids.
                  Tooth brushing. Brush your teeth at least twice a day (especially before going to bed at night) with
                  an ADA approved soft bristle brush and toothpaste. Brush at a 45 degree angle to the gums, gently
                  using a small, circular motion, ensuring that you always feel the bristles on the gums. Brush the
                  outer, inner, and biting surfaces of each tooth. Use the tip of the brush head to clean the inside
                  front teeth. Brush your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath. Electric toothbrushes are
                  also recommended. They are easy to use and can remove plaque efficiently. Simply place the bristles of
                  the electric brush on your gums and teeth and allow the brush to do its job, several teeth at a time.
                  Flossing. Daily flossing is the best way to clean between the teeth and under the gum line. Flossing
                  not only helps clean these spaces, it disrupts plaque colonies from building up, preventing damage to
                  the gums, teeth, and bone. Take 12-16 inches (30-40cm) of dental floss and wrap it around your middle
                  fingers, leaving about 2 inches (5cm) of floss between the hands. Using your thumbs and forefingers to
                  guide the floss, gently insert the floss between teeth using a sawing motion. Curve the floss into a
                  "C" shape around each tooth and under the gum line. Gently move the floss up and down, cleaning the
                  side of each tooth. Floss holders are recommended if you have difficulty using conventional floss.
                  Rinsing. It is important to rinse your mouth with water after brushing, and also after meals if you
                  are unable to brush. If you are using an over-the-counter product for rinsing, it's a good idea to
                  consult with your dentist or dental hygienist on its appropriateness for you.

                  <Strong>A. Over the years there has been </Strong> some concern as to the safety of amalgam (silver)
                  fillings. An amalgam is a blend of copper, silver, tin and zinc, bound by elemental mercury. Dentists
                  haveused this blended metal to fill teeth for more than 100 years. The controversy is due to claims
                  that the exposure to the vapor and minute particles from the mercury can cause a variety of health
                  problems. According to the American Dental Association (ADA), up to 76% of dentists use silver
                  containing mercury to fill teeth. The ADA also states that silver fillings are safe and that studies
                  have failed to find any link between silver containing mercury and any medical disorder. The general
                  consensus is that amalgam (silver) fillings are safe. Along with the ADA's position, the Center for
                  Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization, the FDA, and others support the use of silver
                  fillings as safe, durable, and cost effective. The U.S. Public Health Service says that the only
                  reason not to use silver fillings is when a patient has an allergy to any component of this type of
                  filling. The ADA has had fewer than 100 reported incidents of an allergy to components of silver
                  fillings, and this is out of countless millions of silver fillings over the decades. Although studies
                  indicate that there are no measurable health risks to patients who have silver fillings, we do know
                  that mercury is a toxic material when we are exposed at high, unsafe levels. For instance, we have
                  been warned to limit the consumption of certain types of fish that carry high levels of mercury in
                  them. However, with respect to amalgam fillings, the ADA maintains that when the mercury combines with
                  the other components of the filling, it becomes an inactive substance that is safe.
                  There are numerous options to silver fillings, including composite (tooth-colored), porcelain, and
                  gold fillings. We encourage you to discuss these options with your dentist so you can determine which
                  is the best option for you.

                  <br><strong>Removal Of calculus (tartar):</strong> Calculus is hardened plaque that has been left on
                  the tooth for sometime and is now firmly attached to the tooth surface. Calculus forms above and below
                  the gum line, and can only be removed with special dental instruments.
                  <br><strong>Removal of plaque:</strong> Plaque is a sticky, almost invisible film that forms on the
                  teeth. It is a growing colony of living bacteria, food debris, and saliva. The bacteria produce toxins
                  (poisons) that inflame the gums. This inflammation is the start of periodontal disease!
                  <br><Strong>Teeth polishing:</Strong> Removes stain and plaque that is not otherwise removed during
                  tooth brushing and scaling.
                  <br><strong>Oral hygiene recommendations:</strong> Review and recommend oral hygiene aids as needed
                  (electric dental toothbrushes, special cleaning aids, fluorides, rinses, etc.).
                  <br><strong>Review dietary habits:</strong> Your eating habits play a very important role in your
                  dental health. As you can see, a good dental exam and cleaning involves quite a lot more than just
                  checking for cavities and polishing your teeth. We are committed to providing you with the best
                  possible care, and to do so will require regular check-ups and cleanings.

                  improve your smile, cosmetic dental treatments may be the answer to a more beautiful, confident smile.
                  Cosmetic dentistry has become very popular in the last several years, not only due the many advances
                  in cosmetic dental procedures and materials available today, but also because patients are becoming
                  more and more focused on improving their overall health. This includes dental prevention and having a
                  healthier, whiter, more radiant smile. There are many cosmetic dental procedures available to improve
                  your teeth and enhance your smile. Depending on your particular needs, cosmetic dental treatments can
                  change your smile dramatically, from restoring a single tooth to having a full mouth make-over. Ask
                  your dentist how you can improve the health and beauty of your smile with cosmetic dentistry.<br><br>
                  <strong>Cosmetic Procedures:</strong>
                  Teeth Whitening: Bleaching lightens teeth that have been stained or discolored by age, food, drink,
                  and smoking. Teeth darkened as a result of injury or taking certain medications can also be bleached,
                  but the effectiveness depends on the degree of staining present.
                  Composite (tooth-colored) Fillings: Also known as "bonding", composite fillings are now widely used
                  instead of amalgam (silver) fillings to repair teeth with cavities, and also to replace old defective
                  fillings. Tooth-colored fillings are also used to repair chipped, broken, or discolored teeth. This
                  type of filling is also very useful to fill in gaps and to protect sensitive, exposed root surfaces
                  caused by gum recession.
                  Porcelain Veneers: Veneers are thin custom-made, tooth-colored shells that are bonded onto the fronts
                  of teeth to create a beautiful individual smile. They can help restore or camouflage damaged,
                  discolored, poorly shaped, or misaligned teeth. Unlike crowns, veneers require minimal tooth structure
                  to be removed from the surface of the tooth.<br>
                  <br>
                  Porcelain Crowns (caps): A crown is a tooth-colored, custom-made covering that encases the entire
                  tooth surface restoring it to its original shape and size. Crowns protect and strengthen teeth that
                  cannot be restored with fillings or other types of restorations. They are ideal for teeth that have
                  large, fractured or broken fillings and also for those that are badly decayed.
                  Dental Implants: Dental implants are artificial roots that are surgically placed into the jaw to
                  replace one or more missing teeth. Porcelain crowns, bridges, and dentures can be made specifically to
                  fit and attach to implants, giving a patient a strong, stable, and durable solution to removable
                  dental appliances.
                  Orthodontics: Less visible and more effective brackets and wires are making straightening teeth with
                  orthodontics much more appealing to adult patients. Also, in some cases, teeth may be straightened
                  with custom-made, clear, removable aligners that require no braces.
                  Thanks to the advances in modern dentistry, cosmetic treatments can make a difference in making your
                  smile shine!

                  <Strong>A. Porcelain veneers are very</Strong> thin shells of tooth-shaped porcelain that are
                  individually crafted to cover the fronts of teeth. They are very durable and will not stain, making
                  them a very popular solution for those seeking to restore or enhance the beauty of their smile.
                  Getting veneers usually requires two visits. Veneers are created from an impression (mold) of your
                  teeth that is then sent to a professional dental laboratory where each veneer is custom-made (for
                  shape and color) for your individual smile. With little or no anesthesia, teeth are prepared by
                  lightly buffing and shaping the front surface of the teeth to allow for the small thickness of
                  veneers. The veneers are carefully fitted and bonded onto the tooth surface with special bonding
                  cements and occasionally a specialized light may be used to harden and set the bond. Veneers are an
                  excellent dental treatment that can dramatically improve your teeth and give you a natural, beautiful
                  smile.

                  <Strong>A. Since teeth whitening has now</Strong> become the number one aesthetic concern of many
                  patients, there are many products and methods available to achieve a brighter smile. Professional
                  teeth whitening (or bleaching) is a simple, non-invasive dental treatment used to change the color of
                  natural tooth enamel, and is an ideal way to enhance the beauty of your smile. Over-the-counter
                  products are also available, but they are much less effective than professional treatments and may not
                  be approved by the American Dental Association (ADA).
                  As we age, the outer layer of tooth enamel wears away, eventually revealing a darker or yellow shade.
                  The color of our teeth also comes from the inside of the tooth, which may become darker over time.
                  Smoking, drinking coffee, tea, and wine may also contribute to tooth discoloration, making our teeth
                  yellow and dull. Sometimes, teeth can become discolored from taking certain medications as a child,
                  such as tetracycline. Excessive fluoridation (fluorosis) during tooth development can also cause teeth
                  to become discolored. It's important to have your teeth evaluated by your dentist to determine if
                  you're a good candidate for bleaching. Occasionally, tetracycline and fluorosis stains are difficult
                  to bleach and your dentist may offer other options, such as veneers or crowns to cover up such stains.
                  Since teeth whitening only works on natural tooth enamel, it is also important to evaluate replacement
                  of any old fillings, crowns, etc. before bleaching begins. Once the bleaching is done, your dentist
                  can match the new restorations to the shade of the newly whitened teeth. Since teeth whitening is not
                  permanent, a touch-up may be needed every several years to keep your smile looking bright.
                  <br>
                  The most widely used professional teeth whitening systems:<br>
                  <strong>Home teeth whitening systems:</strong> At-home products usually come in a gel form that is
                  placed in a custom-fitted mouth guard (tray), created from a mold of your teeth. The trays are worn
                  either twice a day for approximately 30 minutes, or overnight while you sleep. It usually takes
                  several weeks to achieve the desired results depending on the degree of staining and the desired level
                  of whitening.<br>
                  <strong>In office teeth whitening:</strong> This treatment is done in the dental office and you will
                  see results immediately. It may require more than one visit, with each visit lasting 30 to 60 minutes.
                  While your gums are protected, a bleaching solution is applied to the teeth. A special light may be
                  used to enhance the action of the agent while the teeth are whitened.
                  Some patients may experience tooth sensitivity after having their teeth whitened. This sensation is
                  temporary and subsides shortly after you complete the bleaching process, usually within a few days to
                  one week.
                  Teeth whitening can be very effective and can give you a brighter, whiter, more confident smile!
